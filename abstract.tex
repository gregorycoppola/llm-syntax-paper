This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models in linguistic analysis, specifically focusing on their ability to perform parsing tasks and act as linguistic annotators. We present both qualitative and quantitative analyses of ChatGPT's performance in linguistic tasks, including a notable negative result in direct CoNLL parsing attempts.
