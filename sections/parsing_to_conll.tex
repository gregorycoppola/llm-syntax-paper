Our initial investigation focused on the direct application of ChatGPT to CoNLL parsing tasks. This approach, while theoretically promising, revealed several significant challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Inconsistent output formatting
    \item Difficulty in maintaining strict CoNLL format requirements
    \item Limited ability to handle complex syntactic structures
\end{itemize}

These findings suggest that direct parsing to CoNLL format may not be the most effective approach for utilizing LLMs in linguistic analysis.
