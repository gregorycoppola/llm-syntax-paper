The application of large language models to linguistic analysis presents both opportunities and challenges. While these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human language, their potential for formal linguistic analysis remains largely unexplored. This work seeks to bridge this gap by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigating the direct application of LLMs to standard linguistic tasks
    \item Exploring novel approaches to linguistic annotation using LLMs
    \item Understanding the limitations and capabilities of LLMs in formal linguistic analysis
\end{itemize}

Our findings have implications for both theoretical linguistics and practical applications in natural language processing.
