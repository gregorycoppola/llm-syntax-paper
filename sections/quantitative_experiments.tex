To validate our qualitative findings, we conducted a series of quantitative experiments:

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset selection and preparation
    \item Control conditions
    \item Evaluation metrics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
Our experiments yielded several key findings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance metrics across different linguistic tasks
    \item Comparison with traditional approaches
    \item Analysis of error patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}
The quantitative results support our qualitative observations and provide insights into the practical applications of LLMs in linguistic analysis.
