This study addresses two primary research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To what extent can large language models like ChatGPT perform direct linguistic parsing tasks?
    \item Can ChatGPT effectively act as a linguistic annotator when guided through a structured annotation process?
\end{enumerate}

These questions aim to explore both the direct computational capabilities and the potential for LLMs to serve as linguistic analysis tools when properly prompted.
