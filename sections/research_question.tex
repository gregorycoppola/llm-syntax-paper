This paper is motivated by both the potential and the limits of {\em large language models} (LLM's).

On the one hand, LLM's have transformed many aspects of the field of computer science and the industry.

Many new kinds of workflows are being automated using {\em agentic} strategies.

The thesis of all of this work is that LLM's can {\em automate} complex workflows.
