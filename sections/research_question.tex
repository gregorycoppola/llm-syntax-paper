\subsection{Motivation}


\subsection{Findings}
The central contribution of this work is to provide concrete evidence that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf large language models} can act effectively as {\bf automatic linguists} -- we show that llm's can {\em annotate} important syntactic data with high inter-annotator agreement with our own guidelines and judgement
\end{enumerate}
We believe that this will greatly change the field of artificial intelligence.

We show that in ``out-of-domain tests,'' that the large language model is more accurate and more robust than the {\em Stanford Dependency Parser}, which represents a reasonable baseline for the accuracy of a traditional structural dependency parser.
