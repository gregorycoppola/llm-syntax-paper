\subsection{Traditional Linguistic Analysis}
Traditional linguistic analysis has relied heavily on human expertise and rule-based systems. The development of computational linguistics has introduced various automated approaches, but these often require significant manual effort in creating and maintaining linguistic resources.

\subsection{Large Language Models}
Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human language. These models, trained on vast corpora of text, have shown remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks.

\subsection{CoNLL Format}
The CoNLL format represents a standardized approach to linguistic annotation, particularly for syntactic and semantic analysis. It provides a structured way to represent linguistic features and dependencies in text.
