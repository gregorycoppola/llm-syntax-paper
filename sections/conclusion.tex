Our research has demonstrated both the potential and limitations of using large language models for linguistic analysis. Key findings include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The challenges of direct CoNLL parsing with LLMs
    \item The effectiveness of LLMs as guided linguistic annotators
    \item Quantitative validation of qualitative observations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}
Several promising directions for future research emerge:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved prompt engineering for linguistic tasks
    \item Integration with traditional linguistic tools
    \item Exploration of other linguistic annotation formats
\end{itemize}

These findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs can be effectively utilized in linguistic research and practical applications.
