\subsection{Zero-Shot Parsing and Negative Results}
We have replicated and expanded upon certain {\em negative} results from the literature pertaining to whether or not LLM's can do {\em zero-shot} parsing straight to the CoNLL format, to to ``annotate'' in contexts where the prompt is incorrect.

We have seen that {\em prompt strategy matters}, and that an overall {\em type} of annotation (e.g., prepositional phrase attachment) that can be gotten annotated accurately through one {\em prompting style} might be totally different in a different prompting style.
