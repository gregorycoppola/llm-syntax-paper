\paragraph{Mixed Results as a Linguistic Annotator}
Past work has shown mixed results.

Past work {\em has} shown that {\em large language models} do {\em not} work as {\em zero-shot CoNLL parsers} (TODO: cite).

On the other hand, there also {\em has} been some important work that showed that llm's {\em can} in fact reliably put out labels that correspond to reality of syntactic judgmements (TODO: cite, zettlemoyer, other stuff).

So, the picture has been somewhat mixed.


\paragraph{Specific Targeted Focus}

Our interest here has been the task of {\em semantic parsing}.
Towards this end, there has been an emphasis on the parsing to structures that will support this.
Unlike the (TODO: cite Bulgarian girl), for example, we are not simply interested in whether or not arbitrary judgements work.
We are interested in the ones that are specifically related to syntactic parsing.
TODO: actually the Bulgarian girl paper was related to semantic parsing

Whereas others have sought perhaps to focus on the limitations of complex judgements, our focus has instead been on the question of finding simple judgements that the large language model {\em can} make.

Rather than looking for evidence of limitations---we want to find any glimmer of a reliable signal.
