\begin{itemize}
    \item a {\em positional argument} that the only thing blocking {\em open-domain parsing} is the ability for a LLM to act ``as a linguist''
    \item a {\em meta-analysis} of past results on the question of whether LLM's can act ``as linguists''
    \item replication of past {\em negative} results on the ability for LLM's to do ``zero-shot'' parsing to CoNLL trees as well as a new (CHECK) algoritmic explanation as to why
    \item several {\em new positive results} showing in novel crucial tasks related to the ``pipeline'' of semantic parsing that LLM's {\em can} act effectively as annotation labelers
    \item a mix of qualitative data and quantitative analyses of {\em LLM's as linguists} showing both qualitative and quantitative evdience that LLM's have ``linguisti knowledge''
    \item results indicating the importance of the {\em prompting strategy} on getting effective and accurate results
