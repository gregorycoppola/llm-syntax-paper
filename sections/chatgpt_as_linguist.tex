Despite the challenges in direct CoNLL parsing, our qualitative analysis revealed that ChatGPT can effectively function as a linguistic annotator when properly guided. This section presents:

\subsection{Methodology}
We developed a structured approach to linguistic annotation using ChatGPT, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear annotation guidelines
    \item Iterative refinement of prompts
    \item Validation of annotations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Case Studies}
Several detailed case studies demonstrate ChatGPT's ability to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify syntactic structures
    \item Analyze morphological features
    \item Provide linguistic explanations
\end{itemize}
